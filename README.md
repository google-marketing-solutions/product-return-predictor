# Product Return Predictor

## Problem
We need to reduce returns for retailers, to increase sustainability and profit.
A product can be returned for various reasons, including quality and size
issues. There are also challenges such as “wardrobing” which is where customers
purchase an item with the intention of returning it once it has been used for a
specific purpose.

## Solution
To address the return issue for our retail advertisers, the product return
solution leverages machine learning to predict refund amount at transaction
level so that advertisers can use updated transaction value by taking refund
amount into account instead of the transaction value for bidding to make sure
they are targeting at customers that are more profitable.
